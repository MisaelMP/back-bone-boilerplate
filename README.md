# Backbone Boilerplate

Something a lot of developers struggle with when setting up for a larger application is to figure out how all the pieces of a framework fit together. Most of the time this results in something horrible that is refactored over time when they are more experienced with it. While the TodoApp is a great way to see how stuff works, they usually lack the structure for a larger maintainable application.

So... I made a boilerplate project for Backbone. Pull requests, questions and suggestions are more than welcome!
